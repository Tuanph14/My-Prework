Prework - Machine Learning

1. Find the body characteristic that's most strongly correlated with Adiposity (how fat one is). That could be asked this way: what's the best thing to measure if I want to predict how fat you are? Should I measure your ankle, your neck, your abdomen, etc?

2. What's the biggest change in this correlation between characteristics and adiposity as bodies age past 45? That could be asked this way: what characteristic changes the most as you age?
